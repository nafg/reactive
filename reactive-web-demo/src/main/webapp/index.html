  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Reactive-web is a new framework for writing highly interactive and
    dynamic web applications. It's written in <a
      href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> , sits on top of <a
      href="http://liftweb.net">Lift</a>, and uses the Functional
    Reactive Programming library reactive-core (it's in the same
    repository).
  </p>
  <p>As in GWT, you can code the user interface in the same language
    as the rest of your application (except
    in Scala instead of Java), rather than writing JavaScript. Unlike
    GWT, however, you don't need an extra build step to convert your code
    to JavaScript. You can easily combine code that runs on the
    browser with code that runs on the server.
    And, you can declare dynamic relationships between components, like
    binding in Flex/JavaFX/etc. (only much more powerful).</p>
  <p>Your webapp can interact with browser elements as if they were
    regular objects inside the JVM. You can handle events from DOM
    elements in your code, and you can update DOM objects by mutating
    the corresponding object. And you can assign dynamically evaluated
    expressions, and the browser will update automatically (more
    easily and powerfully than with Lift's built in wiring).
    These relationships can be enforced from within the browser,
    or they can involve the server if need be.</p>
  <p>Reactive has powerful support for incremental updates. So you
    can have a set of items transformed it in all sorts of ways and
    rendered, and when the set of items changes, only the necessary
    changes will be made to the DOM.</p>
  <p>It is extremely testable. You can write Selenium-style tests &mdash;
     but they don't require starting up a browser or Jetty, and your
     tests can access and interact with both the "user interface"
     as well as the server-side objects (such as the contents
     of a snippet class).</p>
  <p>You can use it within a regular Lift application, in one place
    or throughout. Or you can use it to completely change the kind of
    webapps you write. No longer do webapps have to be less dynamic than
    GUI applications. (You can even use it to build a rich desktop GUI
    app &mdash; just run Jetty embedded!)</p>
  <p>Its functional design works very well with the Lift template
    binding mechanisms, so you
    can keep view design completely separate from your code.</p>
  <p>Updates that are computed on the server can arrive at the browser
    as part of the original page load, as part of an ajax response
    (if they occurred in response to an ajax call), or via Lift's
    superb comet support. It all happens automatically, so you
    don't have to worry about which; reactive-web will select
    the one that's appropriate.</p>

    You can discuss reactive on the <a
      href="scala-user@googlegroups.com">scala-user</a> or <a
      href="mailto:liftweb@googlegroups.com">Lift</a> lists, or you can
    <a href="https://github.com/inbox/new/nafg">send me a message on
      github</a>. Looking forward to your constructive criticism!
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is at <a href="http://github.com/nafg/reactive">http://github.com/nafg/reactive</a>.
    Note that while there is still much to be done, it's more in terms
    of completeness (like adding more elements and properties, and more
    features) than in terms of plumbing or usability.
  </p>
  <p>Some planned features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Onsubmit event, so you can use it when JavaScript is not
      enabled or supported</li>
    <li>JavaScript signals (event streams are already implemented)</li>
    <li>Widgets, from scratch and/or ExtJS etc.</li>
  </ul>
