  <h2>Testing</h2>
  <p>
    <code>Reactive-web</code>
    has very powerful support for user interface testing. You can do
    most things Selenium is usually used for, but you don't have to run
    a browser or Jetty, and your tests can have direct access to server
    objects like snippet classes. Here's a little taste:
  </p>
  <pre class="brush:scala">
  val ts: TestScope = ...
  def phone = ts / "#phone"  // the element with id 'phone'
  // type in it (it's a text input)
  phone sendKeys cust.home_phone.is
  // check that the snippet received the value we typed
  snippet.phone.now should equal (cust.home_phone.is)
  // check that the DOM was updated (the customer who's phone we typed was loaded)
  ts / ".firstname" attr "value" should equal (cust.firstName.is)
  </pre>  
  <p>
    It builds on two things: (1) All updates in
    <code>reactive</code>
    go to the thread-locally current
    <code>Scope</code>
    ; and (2) DOM updates have a semantic (case class) representation.
    The way it works is that there is a
    <code>Scope</code>,
    <code>TestScope</code>, that maintains XML (representing the browser's theoretical
    contents, or part of it), and whenever a DOM update is called for,
    it applies the transformation to its own XML. This way, you can
    always tell what the browser's DOM would look like. In addition, you
    can simulate events, and it has a DSL that makes checking the DOM
    very concise.
  </p>
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>
    You will probably want to surround your tests with
    <code>net.liftweb.mockweb.MockWeb.testS("/") { ... }</code>
    so you can run snippets outside of an actual HTTP context.
  </p>
  <p>Next, you need to generate the initial state of the browser. So
    you need to instantiate instances of your snippet classes, and tell
    Lift to run the template with those snippets. For example:</p>
  <pre class="brush: scala">
  val snippet = new EditOrder
  val page = {
    S.mapSnippet("EditOrder", snippet.render)
    S.runTemplate("orders" :: "edit" :: Nil).open_!
  }
  </pre>
  <p>(It's fine to use <code>open_!</code> because if the template cannot be run, we want the test to abort.)</p>
  <p>
    Now, instantiate a
    <code>TestScope</code>
    with the output, and use it as the scope for your tests. Also import
    its members &mdash; it has some important implicits.
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: scala">
  val ts = new TestScope(page)
  import ts._
  Reactions.inScope(ts) {
    // test things here
  }
  </pre>
  <h3>Accessing the DOM and interacting with it</h3>
  <p>
    The current xml can be accessed as a
    <code>NodeSeq</code>
    by writing
    <code>ts.xml</code>. You can use all of Scala's existing features to analyze it, such
    as the simple XPath support available with
    <code>\</code>
    and
    <code>\\</code>, the collections'
    <code>find</code>. In addition TestScope provides some powerful searching tools
    (using implicits). There are six searching operators, which are used
    like this:
    <code>node / pred</code>, or like this:
    <code>node / (pred1, ... predN)</code>, and returns a node or nodes that satisfy all predicates.
    Predicates are explained below. All six operators take a varargs, so
    they can be used in either form. Also they can be used either on a
    <code>Seq[Node]</code>
    (which every
    <code>Node</code>
    is, by the way), or on the
    <code>TestScope</code>
    itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The six operators are
    <code>/</code>,
    <code>/?</code>,
    <code>/+</code>,
    <code>&gt;</code>,
    <code>&gt;?</code>, and
    <code>&gt;+</code>.
    <code>/</code>
    means search all descendants (and the node itself), while
    <code>&gt;</code>
    means only search direct children.
    <code>?</code>
    means it an
    <code>Option[Node]</code>,
    <code>+</code>
    that it returns a
    <code>Seq[Node]</code>, and no suffix means it returns a
    <code>Node</code>
    or throws an exception if none is found.
  </p>
  <p>
    Predicates are any
    <code>Node=&gt;Boolean</code>, a useful implicit lets you write common predicates as
    strings. You can write strings of the form
    <code>"label"</code>,
    <code>"#id"</code>,
    <code>".class"</code>,
    <code>":name"</code>,
    <code>"=exact match of text"</code>, or
    <code>"~substring of text"</code>. As an illustration, instead of the XPath expression
    <code>//fieldset[legend/text()='Items']</code>
    (as you might in Selenium), you can write
    <code>ts / ("fieldset", _ /? ("legend", "=Items") isDefined)</code>. This means, find a node whose label is "fieldset" (the first
    predicate), and that the function passed as the second predicate
    returns true for. That function searches the fieldset for a node
    whose label is "legend", and whose text content is "Items". Since it
    uses
    <code>/?</code>, the result, if any, is put in an
    <code>Option</code>, on which we can call
    <code>isDefined</code>    to get a
    <code>Boolean</code>
    indication of its presence, making it a valid predicate function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, as a shortcut, you can get a node by id just by writing
    <code>testScope("anId")</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another implicit conversion wraps a
    <code>Node</code>
    as a
    <code>PowerNode</code>, which has several convenient members:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><code>attr</code></dt><dd>The attributes as a <code>Map[String, String]</code></dd>
    <dt><code>update</code></dt><dd>Replace the TestScopes DOM with one that has a different
    attribute value in this node. The node itself is immutable and won't have
    the new value, but update looks up the new node and returns it.
    This requires that the node has an id attribute (and assumes you aren't
    changing it). Usage: <code>node("attribute") = "value"</code></dd>
    <dt><code>id</code></dt>
    <dd>The value of the id attribute</dd>
    <dt><code>clazz</code></dt><dd>The value of the class attribute</dd>
    <dt><code>classes</code></dt><dd>A <code>Set[String]</code> consisting of the
    class attribute split on whitespace.</dd>
    <dt><code>value</code></dt><dd>The value of the value attribute.
    You can also set it (<code>node.value = "xyz"</code>), which
    calls <code>update</code>.</dd>
    <dt><code>fire(event)</code></dt><dd>Simulate an event being fired on this node.
    <code>event</code> is a <code>DomEvent</code>.
    This works by analyzing the corresponding event attribute on the node
    for events and property updates its fires.
    Currently only implemented for Change, Click, and KeyUp.</dd>
    <dt><code>sendKeys(text)</code></dt><dd>Simulates typing in a field. <code>text</code>
    may contain <code>'\b'</code> which is treated as a backspace.
    For each character, it updates the <code>value attribute</code>
    and fires a <code>KeyUp</code> event, and finally it fires
    a <code>Change</code> event.</dd>
  </dl>

<h3>Limitations as compared to Selenium</h3>
<ol>
<li>No XPath. Instead of <code>"//fieldset[legend/text()='Items']"</code> do something like <code>ts / ("fieldset", _ /? "=Items" isDefined)</code></li>
<li>Currently no support for alerts, confirms, etc.</li>
<li>Currently only works with javascript generated by <code>reactive-web</code>.</li>
<li>Since events are artificially simulated, there may be some differences to real life based on how browsers handle events.</li>
<li>You can't see what's happening. Of course, you can work around this by rendering the xml at each step somewhere.
One possibility is to use something like Flying Saucer to render it to a Swing component. Another is to run the tests
from within a webapp and insert the xml into the DOM to display it.</li>
</ol>
