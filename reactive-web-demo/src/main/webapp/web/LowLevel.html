<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Most of the time you don't need to think about <code>reactive-web</code>'s
internals. However, to reason about more complex situations, it may be
helpful to understand what's happening behind the scenes. That said, the
following is not meant to paint a picture about typical usage of the
library.</p>
<p>At its heart, deep down, <code>reactive-web</code> is a
simple abstraction over Lift's excellent Ajax and Comet support. It allows
one to designate a dynamic (thread-local) scope for executing javascript.
Some scopes execute javascript by sending it to a comet actor, while others
render it as an ajax response, or as part of the page's initial rendering.
Within such a scope, <code>reactive-web</code> allows one to queue javascript
to be run in the browser, without caring what scope the code is in or how
the javascript will get to the browser.</p>
<p><code>reactive-web</code> builds on this, using <code>reactive-core</code>'s FRP features,
plus its own <code>JsEventStream</code>, to provide concise, composable abstractions for rendering highly
interactive and dynamic browser content.</p>
<p>More specifically, the default scope that collects queued javascript
is called DefaultScope, and passes all javascript to <code>S.appendJs</code>,
which allows the javascript to be rendered to the current page, or as
part of an ajax or comet request.</p>
<p>When a <code>reactive-web</code> ajax call comes in, it is handled within
a <code>LocalScope</code>, which stores up queued javascript. <code>Reactive-web</code>'s
ajax handler then returns that javascript to the browser as the ajax response.</p>
<p>Generally, <code>reactive-web</code> objects require an implicit <code>Page</code> object,
which uniquely identifies a page. This is so that they can wrap updates in a <code>Reactions.inAnyScope</code> block,
so that they can work via comet when called outside of an ajax request (and after the page has been rendered).
The way this works is that there is a <code>RequestVar[Page]</code> that generates
a new <code>Page</code> at most once per page (counting the page render together
with ajax calls that Lift associates with it), whose value is available implicitly.
When, for instance, you render a <code>PropertyVar</code>, it saves a (weak) reference to
the <code>Page</code>. If that <code>PropertyVar</code> is later mutated, <code>reactive-web</code>
will generate the appropriate javascript and queue it. If this occurs during an ajax request that
is associated with the <code>Page</code>, then when the request completes its response will
include that javascript. If, on the other hand, the <code>PropertyVar</code> is updated
in response to an event that originates on the server &mdash; or on another page, for that matter &mdash;
then the javascript will be sent to the page's comet actor.</p>
