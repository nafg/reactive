  <h3>Double-click</h3>
  <p>Sometimes you want to know if an event happened twice in a row
    within a short amount of time. A common example is detecting a
    double click in a GUI.</p>
  <pre class="brush: scala">
    clicks.map(_ =&gt; System.currentTimeMillis)
      .foldLeft((0L,0L)) {
        case ((_, lastT), newT) =&gt; (lastT, newT)
      }.collect{ case (lastT, newT) if newT-lastT &lt; 500 =&gt; () }
  </pre>

  <h4>EventStreams of different event types</h4>
  <p>
    Sometimes one needs to deal with events of the type
    <code>EventStream[(X,Y)]</code>
    where
    <code>X</code>
    represents the event type and
    <code>Y</code>
    is the event value, and one needs to keep previous state for each
    event type for further calculations. This is not as straightforward
    as the previous case. When the possibilities for X are known, the
    simplest solution may be to derive an event stream for each
    possibility containing only the events of that type, using
    <code>filter</code>. Another possible solution is to keep the last two values and times
    per type of event using
    <code>Map</code>s:
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: scala">
  def lastValues[X, Y](x: EventStream[(X, Y)], defaultX: X) = x.foldLeft((Map.empty[X, (Y, Long)], Map.empty[X, (Y, Long)], defaultX)) {
    case ((mapBeforeLast, mapLastT, b), (a, v)) =&gt; (mapLastT, mapLastT updated(a, (v, System.currentTimeMillis)), a)
  }.collect {
    case ((mapLastT, mapNewT, a)) =&gt;
      for (
        (x1, t1) &lt;- mapNewT.get(a);
        (x0, t0) &lt;- mapLastT.get(a)
      ) yield (ctl, (x1, t1), (x0, t0))
  }

  val x = new EventSource[(String,Double)]

  //double clicks:
  val doubleClicks = lastValues(x, "").collect {
    case Some( (key, (x1, t1), (x0, t0)) ) if t1 - t0 &lt; 500 =&gt; "double click from: "+key
  }

  doubleClicks.foreach(println)

  x.fire( ("mouse",2.0) )
  x.fire( ("mouse",4.0) )
  x.fire( ("trackpad",2.3) )
  x.fire( ("trackpad",5.3) )
  x.fire( ("joystick",5.3) )
  
  //results
  //double click from: mouse
  //double click from: trackpad
  </pre>
