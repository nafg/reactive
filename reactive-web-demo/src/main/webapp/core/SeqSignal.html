<h3><code>SeqSignal</code></h3>
<p>Here is one of the most important and powerful features of <code>reactive</code>.
Suppose you have a list of contacts displayed. Whenever a contact is
added, removed, or updated, you need to update the display. Well, you
keep the list in a <code>Signal[Seq[Contact]]</code>, listen to change
events, and update the display in response. You could have the display
be represented by a <code>map</code>ped <code>Signal</code>. But it's
expensive, especially with a lot of contacts, to update the entire
display whenever a single row changes.</p>
<p>For this reason, there is a special subtype of <code>Signal</code>,
<code>SeqSignal</code>. It adds, on top of <code>Signal</code>'s
members, an additional <code>EventStream[SeqDelta]</code> called <code>deltas</code>.
Depending on how you create the first <code>SeqSignal</code> in the
chain, it will fire <code>SeqDelta</code> events representing inserts,
removes, and updates. In addition multiple operations may be batched in
a single event, so for example multiple deletions do not need to result
in multiple, separate repaints. When you <code>map</code> or <code>flatMap</code>
a <code>SeqSignal</code>, the resulting <code>SeqSignal</code> fires
delta events whose relationship to the delta events fired by the orignal
<code>SeqSignal</code> is defined by the function you pass to <code>map</code>
or <code>flatMap</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that <code>SeqSignal[T]</code> extends <code>Signal[Seq[T]]</code>.
So if you want to transform the elements a <code>SeqSignal</code>, you
need to nest one <code>map</code> inside another: you have to pass the <code>map</code>
method on <code>SeqSignal[T]</code> / <code>Signal[Seq[T]]</code> a
function that operates on a <code>Seq[T]</code>, and since you want to
operate on the elements inside that <code>Seq</code>, you need to call <code>map</code>
on <em>it</em>.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
// When in.deltas fires an Insert of 3,
// the returned SeqSignal's deltas will
// fire an Insert of 30,
// besides that now and change will
// have the behavior inherited from Signal
def timesTen(in: SeqSignal[Int]) =
  in.map { _ map (_ * 10)}
</pre>


<h3>Creating a <code>SeqSignal</code></h3>
<p>How do you get a <code>SeqSignal</code>?</p>
<p>One way is subtype <code>BufferSignal</code>. The easiest way to
create a <code>BufferSignal</code> is with its factory (see example
below). You can modify it in two ways: Either use <code>def value</code>,
which returns an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> which you can mutate directly,
with each mutation resulting in the corresponding deltas being fired; or
use the same syntax you use to update <code>Var</code>s (see example),
which will result in diff being calculated between the old and the new
values. You can override <code>def comparator</code> to change the
equality test used by the diffing algorithm.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
val bufferSignal = BufferSignal(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
bufferSignal.value += 6  // fires an Insert
bufferSignal ()= List(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)  // fires a Remove and an Insert
</pre>

<p>The other way is to use the <code>SeqSignal</code> factory, which
takes a <code>Signal[Seq[T]]</code> and returns a <code>SeqSignal[T]</code>
whose deltas are calculated by running the diffing algorithm on every
change. To create an immutable <code>SeqSignal</code>, just pass it a <code>Val</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush:scala">
val simpleSignal = Var(List(1,2,3))
val seqSignal = SeqSignal(simpleSignal)
simpleSignal ()= List(2,3,4) // seqSignal.deltas fires
                             // a Remove and an Insert.
</pre></div>
