/**
 * An EventStream is a source of events (arbitrary values sent to listener functions).
 * You can fire events from it, you can react to events with any behavior, and you can
 * create derived EventStreams, whose events are based on the original EventStream.
 * The API is modeled after the Scala standard library collections framework.
 *
 * An EventStream is like a collection in the sense that it consists of multiple values.
 * However, unlike actual collections, the values are not available upon request; they
 * occur whenever they occur. Nevertheless, many operations that apply to collections
 * apply to event streams. To react to events, use foreach or foldLeft. To create derived,
 * transformed EventStreams, use map, flatMap, filter, foldLeft, and the | (union) operator.
 * Note that you can of course use for comprehensions as syntactic sugar for many
 * of the above.
 *
 * Methods that return a new EventStream generally do not require an (implicit) Observing.
 * Instead, the new EventStream itself holds references to the parent EventStream and
 * the event function (which refers to, or is, the function passed in to the method).
 * (As a result, if you derive EventStreams with a function that performs side effects,
 * in order to ensure that the function is not garbage collected you must retain a reference
 * to the resulting EventStream.)
 *
 * On the other hand, methods which do require an Observing take functions which are expected
 * perform side effects, and therefore do not hold a reference to the function themselves but
 * rather use the Observing for that purpose. As a result, they will remain in memory as long
 * as the Observing object does.
 *
 * You can also create a Signal from an EventStream using hold.
 * @tparam T the type of values fired as events
