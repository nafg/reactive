   * In addition, every change to the parent results in a change event

   * The signal will hold values of type (T, ()=>Boolean), where T is the type of the
   * parent signal, and the value tuple will contain the parent's value at
   * the last time it was received, as well as a function that can be used to test
   * whether that value is outdated because the parent has received a new value.
